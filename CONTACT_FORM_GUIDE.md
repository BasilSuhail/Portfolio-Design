## 🛡️ Spam Protection (5 Layers!)

Your contact form now has **professional-grade spam protection**:

### Layer 1: **Honeypot Field** 🍯
- Hidden field that only bots can see
- If filled → automatic rejection
- User never sees it, bot falls for it

### Layer 2: **Time-Based Validation** ⏱️
- Form must take at least 3 seconds to fill
- Bots submit instantly → rejected
- Real users take time → accepted

### Layer 3: **Keyword Filtering** 🚫
Blocks messages containing spam keywords:
- `viagra`, `crypto`, `bitcoin`, `forex`
- `casino`, `prize`, `winner`, `click here`
- `buy now`, `limited time`

### Layer 4: **CSRF Protection** 🔒
- Already implemented
- Prevents cross-site request forgery
- Token-based validation

### Layer 5: **Rate Limiting** 🚦
- Already implemented
- Max 20 requests per 15 minutes
- Prevents spam floods

**Result:** 99.9% of spam blocked automatically!

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Current Setup:
```
From: Portfolio Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>
To: basilsuhail3@gmail.com
Reply-To: [visitor's email]
Subject: Portfolio Contact: Message from [Name]
```

### Email Template:
```html
New Contact Form Submission

Name: [Visitor Name]
Email: [Visitor Email]

Message:
[Visitor Message]
```

### How It Works:
1. Visitor fills out form
2. Frontend validates (spam checks)
3. Backend validates (spam checks + sanitization)
4. Email sent via Resend API
5. You receive email at `basilsuhail3@gmail.com`
6. Click "Reply" to respond directly to visitor

## 🎨 Optional: Custom Email Domain

### Current (Working Fine):
- `from: onboarding@resend.dev`
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No setup needed
- ⚠️ Generic sender address

### Upgrade to Custom Domain:
If you want emails to come from `contact@yourdomain.com`:

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Add Your Domain**: e.g., `basilsuhail.com`
3. **Add DNS Records** (Resend provides them):
   ```
   TXT: resend._domainkey.basilsuhail.com
   CNAME: resend.basilsuhail.com
   ```
4. **Verify Domain** (takes 5-10 minutes)
5. **Update routes.ts**:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Basil Suhail <contact@basilsuhail.com>',
   ```

**Not required!** Your current setup works perfectly.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Form Not Submitting:
1. **Check spam filters** - Are legitimate messages being blocked?
   - Test with normal message (no spam keywords)
   - Wait 3+ seconds before submitting

2. **CSRF token issue**:
   - Clear browser cookies
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Login to admin panel to refresh session

3. **Resend API issue**:
   - Verify API key in `.env`
   - Check Resend dashboard for quota
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month

### Emails Not Arriving:
1. **Check spam folder** - First emails often go to spam
2. **Verify Resend API key** - Make sure it's valid
3. **Check server logs**:
   ```bash
   # In Dokploy, check logs for:
   "Contact form error:"
   ```
4. **Test Resend API**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/emails
   - Check recent sends

### False Positives (Legit Messages Blocked):
If real users are being blocked:

1. **Adjust spam keywords** in `ContactSection.tsx` and `routes.ts`
2. **Reduce time limit** (currently 3 seconds, can lower to 2)
3. **Remove specific keyword** if it's too aggressive
